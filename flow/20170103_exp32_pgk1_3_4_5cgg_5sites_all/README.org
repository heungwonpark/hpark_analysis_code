* Flow Data Analysis

** Brief Conclusions
- The first two 4xCGG and 5xCGG pauses have a smaller effect on protein expression than the next 3 4xCGG and 5xCGG pauses.
- The first 3xCGG is abnormally low. This might be a technical or cloning error. Make a note of this in the lab strain and plasmid database. Ignore this for now since we are not using the 3xCGG single variants for making double variants.
- Next step is to test the effect of double 4xCGG and double 5xCGG variants and compare them to the single variant data.
